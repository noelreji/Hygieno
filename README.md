# Hygieno

Hygieno is a waste management system that connects people who want to dispose of their waste with nearby collectors who can pick it up. It simplifies waste disposal by allowing users to easily list their waste items and find local collectors to handle the collection.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login**: Users can register as disposers or collectors and securely log in.
- **Waste Listing**: Disposers can list waste items they want to be collected.
- **Waste Collection**: Collectors can view nearby listed wastes and pick up those they are interested in.
- **Location-based Filtering**: Disposers and collectors are matched based on their location to facilitate easier collection.
